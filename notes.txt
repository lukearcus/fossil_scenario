Change Lyapunov to practical Lyapunov/Reachability
for reachability ensure derivative less than maximum divided by time horizon

For paper could have asymptotic stability then for practicality have practical Lyapunov
Could do asymptotic if horizon goes to infinity

Can allow barrier to be slightly positive - look at abolfazl's

Think more on this
